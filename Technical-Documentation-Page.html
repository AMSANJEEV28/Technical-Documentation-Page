        <h2 id="introduction"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> JavaScript is an object-oriented, cross-platform scripting language. It is a compact and light language.
            JavaScript can be attached to the objects of its environment inside a host environment (for example, a web
            browser) to allow programmatic control over them. </p>

        <p> A standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, as well as a basic set of language components,
            such as operators, control structures, and statements, are included in JavaScript. By extending Core
            JavaScript
            with additional objects, it can be used for a variety of applications, such as:</p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Client-side JavaScript adds to the fundamental language by providing objects for controlling a
                browser's
                Document Object Model (DOM). Client-side extensions, for example, allow a programme to add items on an
                HTML
                form and respond to user actions like mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>
            <li> Server-side JavaScript extends the basic language by providing objects required for server-side
                JavaScript
                execution. Server-side extensions, for example, allow an application to interface with a database, give
                information continuity from one programme invocation to the next, or conduct file operations on a
                server.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="aware-of"> What you should already be aware of</h2>
        <p> This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the following:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> An comprehension of the Internet and the World Wide Web on a broad level (WWW).</li>
            <li> Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li> Some programming knowledge is required. Try one of the JavaScript lessons provided on the main page if
                you're new to programming.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul> Some programming knowledge is required. Try one of the JavaScript lessons provided on the main page if
            you're
            new to programming.
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="JSJ"> JavaScript and Java </h2>
        <p> In some aspects, JavaScript and Java are similar, yet fundamentally different in others. JavaScript is
            similar
            to Java, except it lacks Java's static typing and rigorous type checking. JavaScript was renamed from
            LiveScript
            to JavaScript because it follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions, and basic control-flow
            features.
        </p>
        <p> JavaScript offers a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
            textual values, as opposed to Java's compile-time system of classes defined via declarations. Instead of the
            more conventional class-based object model, JavaScript uses a prototype-based object model. The
            prototype-based
            architecture allows for dynamic inheritance, which means that what is inherited for specific objects can
            change.
            JavaScript also offers functions that don't require any extra declarations. Functions can be object
            attributes
            that run as weakly typed methods.</p>
        <p> In comparison to Java, JavaScript is a fairly free-form language. All variables, classes, and methods do not
            need to be declared. You don't have to worry about whether your methods are public, private, or protected,
            and
            you don't have to worry about implementing interfaces. The kinds of variables, arguments, and function
            return
            types are not specified explicitly.</p>
        <h2 id="HW"> Hello World </h2>
        <p> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
            code:
        </p>
        <code> function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
    greetMe("World");  </code></br>
        <p> Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>
        <h2 id="variables"> Variables </h2>
        <p> In your application, variables are used as symbolic names for values. Variable names, often known as
            identifiers, must follow a set of restrictions.</p>
        <p> The first character of a JavaScript identification must be a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); the
            remaining characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, letters include "A"
            through
            "Z" (uppercase) and "a" through "z" (lowercase) (lowercase). </p>
        <p> You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
            escape
            sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>
        <h2 id="declaring-v">Declaring variables</h2>
        <p> You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p> With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42.  </code></br>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>x = 42. </code></br>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
        </p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>let y = 13. </code></br>
        <p> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

        <h2 id="variable-s">Variable scope</h2>
        <p> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
            to
            any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
            variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
            block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
            code
            will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code></br>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not </code></br>
        <code>defined </code></br>
        <h2 id="global-v">Global variables</h2>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so
            you
            can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
            specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
            document,
            you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
        <h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
            same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
            alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14; </code></br>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
            initialized to a value.</p>

        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
            omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5;  </code></br>
        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function  </code></br>
        <code> f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements } </code></br>
        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
        <code> MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue"; </code></br>
        <h2 id="d-t">Data types</h2>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type:circle;">Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"> null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                    is
                    case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"> undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"> Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"> String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"> Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                    unique and
                    immutable.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
            your
            applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
            objects
            as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
        </p>
        <h2 id="if-else">if...else statement</h2>
        <p> Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
            execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } </code></br>
        <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
            evaluates
            to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
            executed.
            statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
            follows:
        </p>
        <code> if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
    } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; } </code></br>
        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
            To
            execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
            to
            always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } </code></br>
        <p> It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
            confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
        <code> if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } </code></br>
        <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
            parentheses
            around the assignment. For example:</p>
        <code>  if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ } </code></br>

        <h2 id="while">while statement</h2>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
            statement
            looks as follows:</p>
        <code>while (condition) statement </code></br>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement
            following the loop.
        </p>
        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
            is
            executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
            passed to the statement following while.</p>
        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>

        <p> Example:</p>
        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } </code></br>
        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following
            values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li> After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li> After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

                <h2 id="f-d">Function declarations</h2>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li> A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li> The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; } </code></br>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says
                    to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                    specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                <code>return number * number; </code></br>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally
                    or in the calling function.</p>
